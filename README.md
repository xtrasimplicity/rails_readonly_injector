[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xtrasimplicity/rails_readonly_injector.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xtrasimplicity/rails_readonly_injector)[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/151a348c5e63129e8dd4/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/xtrasimplicity/rails_readonly_injector/maintainability)<a href="https://codeclimate.com/github/xtrasimplicity/rails_readonly_injector/test_coverage"><img src="https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/151a348c5e63129e8dd4/test_coverage" /></a>

Easily switch a Rails site into 'read-only' mode, and back again, without restarting the server.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails_readonly_injector'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rails_readonly_injector

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install the dependencies.

RSpec specs and Cucumber features are stored in `rspec_specs` and `cucumber_features`, respectively. When `bundle exec rake` is run against an appraisal, the contents of these folders are copied to the necessary folders under the temporary rails application that is generated (by `bundle exec rake`) into `tmp/rails_app`.

To run tests for a specific version of Rails, simply run `bundle exec appraisal {APPRAISAL} bundle exec rake`, where `{APPRAISAL}` is one of the appraisals found under `Appraisals`.
